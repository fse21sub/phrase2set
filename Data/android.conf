#sentence length
## https://strainindex.wordpress.com/2008/07/28/the-average-sentence-length/
## “Over the whole document, make the average sentence length 15-20 words, 25-33 syllables and 75-100 characters.”
## we remove code and hyperlinks, one sentence is short the other is long, so for 2 sentences:
min_chars = 175
